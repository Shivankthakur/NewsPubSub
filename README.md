# Distributed Publish-Subscribe System

This project is a distributed publish-subscribe system using 10 broker nodes, implemented in Python and deployed using Docker. The system supports fault tolerance, leader election, and data replication, providing a scalable solution for message publishing and subscribing.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Prerequisites**

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd NewsPubSub
   cd broker
   ```

### **Running the System**

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. **Deploy the Brokers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Verify that all brokers are running**:
   - Access individual brokers at `http://localhost:8081`, `http://localhost:8082`, ..., `http://localhost:8085`.

4. **View Logs for Debugging**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

### **Stopping the System**

To stop and remove the containers:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## **Testing**

1. **Publish and Replication Test**:
   ```bash
   python tests/test_publish.py
   ```

2. **Leader Election Test**:
   ```bash
   python tests/test_leader_election.py
   ```

## **Implementation Details**

### **1. Failure Detection**
Each broker sends periodic heartbeats to its peers. If a broker does not receive a heartbeat from another broker within a specified timeout, it marks that broker as failed.

### **2. Leader Election**
The leader election follows a simple Bully Election Algorithm, where the broker with the highest ID becomes the leader if no higher ID broker responds.

### **3. Data Replication**
When a message is published to a broker, it stores the message and replicates it to all its peers. The replication ensures data consistency across all brokers.
